# skin-cancer-classification
This project involves the development of a machine learning-based skin cancer classification model using deep learning techniques, specifically MobileNetV2, for the classification of skin lesions into cancerous and non-cancerous categories. The project is built using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit web application.
