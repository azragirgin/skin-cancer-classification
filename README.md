#skin-cancer-classification
This project involves the development of a machine learning-based skin cancer classification model using deep learning techniques, specifically MobileNetV2, for the classification of skin lesions into cancerous and non-cancerous categories. The project is built using TensorFlow/Keras and deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit web application.


#Project Structure
Training: Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 on the ISIC dataset with data augmentation and class balancing using Focal Loss.

Evaluation: Performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

Deployment: A user-friendly Streamlit web app where users can upload skin images and receive predictions, confidence scores, AUC estimations, and Grad-CAM heatmap visual explanations.

Features:
- Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

- Class Imbalance Handling using Focal Loss

- Advanced Visualizations (confusion matrix, Grad-CAM, class distributions)

- Streamlit App for real-time predictions

- Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduler and Early Stopping during training
